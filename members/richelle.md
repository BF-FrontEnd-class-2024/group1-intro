# MOTIVATION LETTER üßëüëàüôèüí™

> ‚ÄúCopy-and-Paste was programmed by programmers for programmers actually.‚Äù

### Dear Ma‚Äôam/Sir

- Prior to this program I did E-learning by myself, I started to learn HTML, CSS
  Javascript, Python, Java from different online platforms like Solo learn, MDN,
  W3Schools.

- I started building an e-commerce site thru Wordpress and learning French and
  Dutch language in between.

- I followed a short 2 weeks Javascript Fundamentals course in Bruxelles
  Formation.

- Something that I love about Web Development is the debugging part. I love
  finding solution to the errors.

- I love collaborating with the team.

- I tried to search for a job like Web Developer on a sites like E-gov Select,
  Ict job, I see that the programming languages skills they're requiring are the
  exact languages you're teaching here In Hack your Future. I could have
  potentials working with these companies if I'll be given a chance entering
  your 5 months program.

- I see your program as an opportunity for me to go back to what I'm passionate
  about.

### Sincerely

Richelle Pintucan

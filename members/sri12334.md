# Hey there! I'm Ramya Sri✋

currently navigating life's adventures with a splash of code and creativity

🙋‍♀️ Originally from India, I embarked on a new chapter in Belgium

nearly two years ago alongside my husband.😅git status

As I sought opportunities, I recognized the need to enhance my skills,

leading me to HYF (Hack Your Future), where I earned my spot in the world of
tech.

🌟 My heart beats for front-end development,

where I weave together lines of code to craft engaging digital experiences.

Alongside my coding journey,

I proudly speak two languages—Telugu and English—and have a good grasp of
Hindi.😀

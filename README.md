# Group 1

This project involves using a Markdown template repository to create a
collaborative get-to-know-you repository for a study group.

Each member will contribute one markdown file to the repository, and the
emphasis is on fostering group cohesion and practicing collaboration within a
shared repository.

The process includes scheduling a meeting to organize the project and creating
an issue in the class repository with specific labels and details for tracking
progress.
